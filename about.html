        <p>
          I'm Valerio, I just became a junior full-stack web developer!
          Techincal skills are a very important part when evaluating an
          individual, <br />
          but we can't forget that we are all very different individuals and
          each of us have different characteristics. I want you to meet the
          Valerio as a person!

          <h3>Valerio Solinas</h3>
          <h4>Get to Know Me</h4>
          <p>
            I'm Valerio Solinas, originally from the stunning island of
            Sardinia, Italy. <br />
            I studied at ITI G.M. Angioy in Sassari, where I earned a diploma in
            Electrical Engineering and Automation/Electronics. <br />
            Outside the screen, I'm passionate about football, travel, and
            anything tech or physics related. <br />
            I enjoy growing my knowledge on anything, simple or complicated, it
            doesn't really matter. <br />
            I loved helping my father when he was working as a builder and
            learning all I could about it. <br />
            I loved helping my mother in her coffee shop and seeing what it
            means to take care not only of tasks but also of people. <br />
            My passion for tech started when I was very young. <br />
            With the help of my uncle, I still remember touching, for the first
            time, the power button on an HP Vectra with Windows 95. <br />
            He opened an editor to create cartoonish pictures and printed my
            first creation. <br />
            For me, that was THE moment! <br />
          </p>

          <h4>My work history</h4>
          <p>
            My work life is just a long adventure: <br />
            In Italy, I did many different roles. <br />
            I started with leafleting from a very young age to financially help
            my family. <br />
            I worked in food delivery for a small restaurant and then worked
            inside the same restaurant. <br />
            From this restaurant, I developed a passion for learning and
            acquiring skills. There, I started by folding pizza boxes until I
            became a pizza chef. <br />
            Wanting more, I jumped from hospitality to an office job (customer
            help center), where my task was to help or fix issues that people
            were encountering during their journey with the company. <br />
            Fortunately for me, the experience I gained from those different
            jobs gave me even more drive to expand my knowledge. <br />
            The next step was to see the world from a different perspective, so
            I decided to move to London. <br />
            It was a bit hard to change cities and get out of my comfort zone,
            everything was different, and my English level at that time was not
            the best. <br />
            I started as a kitchen porter in a pub; this job gave me the chance
            to improve my spoken and written English. <br />
            Hard work always pays off, and from a porter, I became a commis chef
            and so on, until I was in charge of the kitchen and all the
            responsibilities that came with it. <br />
            From there, I moved on to become a kitchen supervisor, a kitchen
            trainer, and eventually into a general supervising role. <br />
            Not wanting to stop, I became an assistant manager, where I learned
            what it means to have responsibility for large teams. <br />
            As an assistant manager, I learned more about the business side and
            administration. <br />
            I currently work as a supervisor in a bakery. I stepped down from
            assistant manager to focus on my growth as a developer. <br />
            These roles have taught me a lot about responsibility, accountability, efficiency,
            and connecting with people. <br />
            At the heart of it, I'm someone who enjoys both structure and
            creativity, and I'm always looking to grow as a developer and as a
            person. <br />
            Not wanting to bind myself to a managerial role (the reason being
            that a managerial role in hospitality was not my dream or goal, and
            also I couldn't fully focus on my personal growth), <br />
            I started getting back to my passion, which is tech-related. I
            started studying with Code Institute, and under the guidance of
            mentors and a tutoring system, I earned my Diploma in Advanced
            Front-End. <br />
