        <p>
          I'm Valerio, I just became a junior full-stack web developer! 
          Techincal skills are a very important part when evaluating an individual, <br>
          but we can't forget that we are all very different individuals and each of us have different characteristics.
          I want you to meet the Valerio as a person!

        <h4>Get to Know Me</h4>
        <p>
          I'm Valerio Solinas,
          originally from the stunning island of Sardinia, Italy. <br> 
          I studied at ITI G.M. Angioy in Sassari, where I earned a diploma in Electrical Engineering and Automation/Electronics. <br>
          Outside the screen, I'm passionate about football, travel, and anything tech or physics related. <br>
          I enjoy to grow my knowledge on anything, simple of complicated doesn't really matter. <br>
          I loved helping my father when he was working as a builder and learning all I could about it. <br>
          I loved helping my mother in her Coffee shop and see what it means to take care not only about tasks but also about people. <br>
          My passion for tech started when I was very young, <br>
          with the help of my uncle I still remember touching for the first time, the power button on a HP Vectra with Windows 95. <br>
          He opened an editor to create cartoonish pictures and printed my first creation. <br>
          For me that was the moment that I realized that I loved designing and how tech would help me to do it. <br>
        </p>
        <h4>My work history</h4>
        <p>
          My work life is just a long adventure: <br>
          In Italy I did many different roles. <br>
          I started from leafleting from a very young age, to financially help my family. <br>
          I worked in food delivery in a small restaurant and then worked in the same restaurant. <br>
          From this restaurant I started to get the passion to learn more and aquire skills, there I started folding pizza boxes until I became a pizza chef. <br>
          Wanting more I jumped from hospitality to an office job (Customer help center) where my task was to help or fix issue that people were encountering during their journey with that company. <br>
          Fortunately for me, the experience that I got from those different jobs gave me more drive to expand my knowledge. <br>
          The next step was to see the world from a different prospective, so I decided to move to London. <br>
          It was a bit hard to change city and get out of my comfort zone, everything was different and my english level at that period was not the best. <br>
          I started as kitchen porter in a pub, this job gave me the chance to improve my spoken and written english. <br>
          Hard work always pays off, and from a porter I became a commis chef and so on until I was in charge of the kitchen and all the responsability that came with that. <br>
          From there I changed to be a kitchen supervisor , a kitchen trainer and moved to a general supervising role. <br>
          Not wanting to stop I became an assistant manager. Where I learned what it means to have responsability for large teams (I was in charge of 35/40 people.). <br>
          As an assistant manager I learned more about the business side and administration. <br>
          I currently work as a supervisor in a bakery. Step down from assistant to focus on my growth as a developer. <br>

          These roles have taught me a lot about responsibility, efficiency, and connecting with people , qualities I bring into every project I build. <br>
          At the heart of it, I'm someone who enjoys both structure and creativity,
          and I'm always looking to grow as a developer and as a person. <br>
          Not wanting to bind myself to a manager role (The reason is that a manager role in hospitality was not my dream or goal and also I couldn't completly focus on my personal growth.) <br> I started getting back on my passion, that is tech related.
          I started studying with Code Institute , under the guidance of Mentors and a tutoring system I earned my Diploma In advanced front-end.
